          <p>I am Pruthvi Patel, an aspiring software developer and data analyst, currently pursuing my Computer Programming and Analysis degree at Seneca College, Toronto. I am passionate about technology and innovation, and I aim to apply my skills and knowledge to create user-friendly and efficient solutions.

I have a strong programming proficiency in C, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I am interested in object-oriented programming with C++. I have also developed full-stack web applications using Node.js, Express.js, and various front-end technologies. Additionally, I have experience in managing complex databases using Oracle SQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, and performing sophisticated data manipulations.

I am familiar with the Unix/Linux operating systems and Git as a version control tool, which are essential for modern software development. I also have project management skills, having used Jira Software to organize and track tasks and milestones. I am always seeking opportunities to grow and learn new technologies and methodologies that can enhance my software development and data analysis capabilities. The place that I like the most is:</p>
